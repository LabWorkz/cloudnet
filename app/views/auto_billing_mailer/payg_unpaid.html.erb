<p>Hi <%= @user.full_name %>!</p>

<p>An automated billing invoice has been generated for your account. The invoice is attached and can also be viewed in the <%= link_to 'billing section', billing_index_url %></p>

<p>Payment could not be deducted from your payment receipts because there was not enough PAYG credit on your account. Please top up your account in the <%= link_to 'billing section', billing_index_url %> to avoid automatic shutdown of your servers.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>The Cloud.net Team</p>
